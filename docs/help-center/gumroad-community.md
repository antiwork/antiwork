## What is Gumroad Community?

Gumroad Community is a free feature that allows you to create dedicated chat spaces for your products. By enabling Community, you can foster direct communication with your customers, answer questions, share updates, and build a community of users around your offerings.

Communities are product-specific, giving your customers a space to connect not just with you but with each other, enhancing the value of your products and reducing churn through increased engagement.

## Enabling Community for your product

To enable the Community feature for one of your products:

1. Go to your product's edit page
2. Find the "Community" toggle in the product settings
3. Switch the toggle to "On"

Once enabled, a new "Community" tab will appear in your product's sidebar, and customers who purchase this product will gain access to its community.

## Managing your Community

### Accessing your Communities

As a seller, you can access all your product communities from the main navigation:

1. Click on "Community" in the main sidebar
2. If this is your first time, you'll see an empty state prompt to enable Community for a product
3. Once enabled for at least one product, you'll see a list of your product communities

### Product-specific chat spaces

Each product with Community enabled has its own dedicated chat space:

- Messages are organized chronologically
- An unread divider shows which messages are new since your last visit
- Daily dividers help organize conversations by date
- You can switch between different product communities using the community switcher

### Community Switcher

The Community Switcher allows you to navigate between different communities:

1. Click on the community name at the top of the chat
2. A dropdown menu will show all available communities:
   - Your own product communities (if you're a seller)
   - Communities from sellers whose products you've purchased

## Community as a buyer

When you purchase a product with Community enabled, you'll gain access to that product's community:

1. On the product's content page, you'll see a "Community" button
2. Clicking this button will take you directly to that product's community
3. You can participate in discussions, ask questions, and connect with the creator and other customers

## Notifications and emails

Stay updated on community activity with customizable notifications:

1. Access notification settings from within any community
2. Choose how you want to be notified about new messages
3. Enable or disable daily and weekly recap emails summarizing community activity

### Recap emails

Keep track of community discussions with optional recap emails:

- **Daily recap**: Get a summary of all community activity from the previous day
- **Weekly recap**: Receive a weekly roundup of the most active discussions

## Editing and deleting messages

### For all users

- You can edit your own messages after posting them
- Edited messages will show an "edited" indicator

### For sellers

- As a product owner, you can delete any message in your product's community
- This moderation capability helps you maintain a positive community environment
